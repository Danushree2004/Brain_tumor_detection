**ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection with YOLOv8 and Grad-CAM++
ðŸ“Œ Overview**

Early detection of brain tumors plays a crucial role in improving patient survival rates. Traditional MRI-based diagnostics depend heavily on manual radiological analysis, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error.

This project integrates YOLOv8 (for real-time tumor localization) with Grad-CAM++ (for interpretability through heatmaps) to provide an accurate, scalable, and explainable deep learning framework for brain tumor detection.

YOLOv8: Achieved 91% accuracy in real-time tumor localization.

Grad-CAM++: Provided 99% accuracy in interpretability by generating heatmaps to highlight tumor regions.

ResNet50 Backbone: Used to enhance feature extraction.
